We're going to start with how arrays are handled. Up to this point we've just been talking about how to sort items in a list but how are the things actually stored in a list? Well, as you guessed, it depends. You'll choose which one you need contextually.</p>\n<p>Big O applies here. We're going to be talking about two ways to implement lists and you'd choose depending on what sort of workload you needed.</p>\n<p>This is actually a bit of a moot point for JavaScript developers: we have normal arrays and no choice beyond anything in the matter. In other languages, however, there are multiple types of array and you choose which one you need based on the sort operations you intend on doing on that array.

No more <code class=\"language-text\">const x = []</code>. We only have one thing: objects. So we'd need to implement the array numbering ourselves. But not just that, we'd have to implment adding numbers, removing numbers, getting numbers, etc. It's a lot of work!</p>\n<p>I'm borrowing the Java terms for these, by the way.</p>\n<p>For array list, this works more or less how we as humans tend think about it: in memory we'll lay out everything sequentially in memory. We'd say that the array starts <em>somewhere</em> and then if we ask for the 2 index, we'd go to the beginning of the array and move over 3 to the 2 index. Since everything is already laid out in the order it's in memory, it makes look-ups really simple. Just by knowing where the start of the array is and the index, we know where the thing we're looking for in memory. This would be a O(1) in terms of complexity. No matter how big the ArrayList is, array lookups take the same amount of time.</p>\n<p>Now imagine our list is 15,000 items long and we delete the 1 index. We now have to shift 14,998 items over in memory. This is called compacting and it's painful for ArrayList. Same applies for inserts.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">\n[a,b,c,d,e,f,g]\n-> delete index 3\n-> array is [a,b,c,(blank),e,f,g]\n-> shift elements 4,5,6 back one index\n-> array is [a,b,c,e,f,g]\n-> decrement length</code></pre></div>\n<p>Keep in mind you have to do an look-up and a deletion in order to do a deletion. This true regardless. We're measuring these actions independently.</p>\n<p>So when are you going to choose an ArrayList? When you need to do lots of lookups! It's the best for that.

We can model how much time any function is going to take given n inputs (think an array of length <code class=\"language-text\">n</code>), but in reality we're interested in the order of magnitude of the number and not necessarily of the exact figure.</p>\n<p>Example: I don't particularly care if a function takes 300 milliseconds versus 330 milliseconds given 1,000 inputs, but I do care if it takes 300 milliseconds versus 30 seconds. This would be a difference in an order of magnitude, or basically we're saying we only care if the difference is large.</p>\n<p>Enter Big O. Think of the O as a vacuum that sucks in all the unimportant information and just leaves you with the important stuff. Let's look at a purely mathematical perspective for a second. Say we have the equation 3x² + x + 1. If we plug in 5, the first term will be 75, the second term will be 5, and the third will be 1.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A \"term\" in mathematics just means one piece of the equation (normally separated by + or - signs). In 3x² + x + 1, 3x² is the first term, x is the second, and 1 is the third.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In other words, most of the piece of the pie comes from the first term, to the point we can just ignore the other terms. If we plug in huge numbers, it becomes even more apparent. IE if we do 5,000,000, the first term is 75,000,000,000,000, the second is 5,000,000, and the last 1. A huge gap.</p>\n<p>Hence this is what Big O does; we ignore the little parts and concentrate on the big parts. Keeping with 3x² + x + 1, the Big O for this equation would be O(n²) where O is just absorbing all the other fluff (including the factor on the biggest term.) Just grab the biggest term. So for n terms, it's going take us n*n time to go through our inputs. So let's see how to derive this from an algorithm.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"javascript\"><pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code class=\"language-javascript\"><span class=\"token keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"token function\">crossAdd</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token parameter\">input</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">var</span> answer <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">for</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token keyword\">var</span> i <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">0</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span> i <span class=\"token operator\">&lt;</span> input<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>length<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span> i<span class=\"token operator\">++</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token keyword\">var</span> goingUp <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> input<span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>i<span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n    <span class=\"token keyword\">var</span> goingDown <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> input<span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>input<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>length <span class=\"token operator\">-</span> <span class=\"token number\">1</span> <span class=\"token operator\">-</span> i<span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n    answer<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">push</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>goingUp <span class=\"token operator\">+</span> goingDown<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">return</span> answer<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>This is O(n) because we go through all the inputs once in a loop.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"javascript\"><pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code class=\"language-javascript\"><span class=\"token keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"token function\">find</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token parameter\">needle<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> haystack</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">for</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token keyword\">var</span> i <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">0</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span> i <span class=\"token operator\">&lt;</span> haystack<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>length<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span> i<span class=\"token operator\">++</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token keyword\">if</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>haystack<span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>i<span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span> <span class=\"token operator\">===</span> needle<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">return</span> <span class=\"token boolean\">true</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>Still O(n).

The red graph represnts O(1) like our <code class=\"language-text\">getMiddleOfArary</code> function. You can throw an array of 1,000,000 at it and it still takes the same amount of time as if the array was 10 big.</p>\n<p>The blue line represents a function that takes longer based on how many items are in the array similar to <code class=\"language-text\">crossAdd</code> or <code class=\"language-text\">find</code> and it grows a steady rate. If it takes 10ms to run a function with a 100 items in it, we could reasonably expect it would take 10 times longer-ish (remember, these are broad strokes, not precise figures) if we had 10 times the amount of things in the array.</p>\n<p>The green line is where we get start getting scary. For every item we add to the array, it takes exponentially more time to complete the operation. Adding 10x the items could cause a function to takes 100x longer since it's O(n²). It gets even scarier at O(n³) as it would take 1000x longer.</p>\n<p>We'll get more into it later, but you can also have O(log n) if a code employs a divide-and-conquer strategy (often recursive,) meaning as you add more terms, the increases in time as you add input diminishes. We'll talk more about that with merge and quick sort.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 800px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/complete-intro-to-computer-science/static/26b7a304a42506939d5959f101b26eb4/5a190/graph-log.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 100%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"log n graph\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/complete-intro-to-computer-science/static/26b7a304a42506939d5959f101b26eb4/5a190/graph-log.png\"\n        srcset=\"/complete-intro-to-computer-science/static/26b7a304a42506939d5959f101b26eb4/772e8/graph-log.png 200w,\n/complete-intro-to-computer-science/static/26b7a304a42506939d5959f101b26eb4/e17e5/graph-log.png 400w,\n/complete-intro-to-computer-science/static/26b7a304a42506939d5959f101b26eb4/5a190/graph-log.png 800w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>Notice the purple line we added.

It's a useful tool for deciding if your designed implementation is going to much the performance profile that you need.</p>\n<p>A good example would be if we were designing a comment system for a site and it had a sorting and filtering ability. If this is for a school and there would only ever be a few comments at a time, we probably don't need to do too much Big O analysis because it's such a small set of people that a computer can overcome just about any computational inefficiency we have. In this case I'd value human time over computer time and just go with the simplest solution and not worry about the Big O unless performance because a problem later.</p>\n<p>Okay, now, if we're designing a comment system but it's for Reddit.com, our needs change <em>dramatically</em>. We're now talking about pipelines of millions of users making billions of comments. Our performance targets need to change to address such volume. A O(n²) alogrithm would crash the site.</p>\n<p>This is absolutely essential to know about Big O analysis. It's useless without context. If you're asked is in a situation if a O(n) or a O(n²) your answer should be \"it depends\" or \"I need more context\". If the O(n) algorithm is extremely difficult to comprehend and the O(n²) algorithm is dramatically easier to understand and performance is a total non-issue, then the O(n²) is a much better choice. It's similar to asking a carpenter if they want a hammer or a sledgehammer without any context. Their answer will be \"what do you need me to do?\".</p>","frontmatter":{"path":"/big-o/","title":"Big O","order":"2A","section":"Algorithm Analysis","description":"Brian goes over how to measure how efficient an algorithm and the tools we have to measure it"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p>Trees are another way to structure data. They work differently that arrays so we won't be looking at the exact same thing but they have their own uses. Arrays can have arbitrary data in arbitrary order. An array of <code class=\"language-text\">[1, 5, 2, 7, 3]</code> is totally fine: it doesn't have to be in a sorted order. The kind of trees we're going to be looking at today are all ordered by value, so whenever you insert a new value, it will be inserted in a sorted fashion e.g. if we add 5 to <code class=\"language-text\">[1, 4, 6, 7]</code> it <em>must</em> be inserted between the 4 and the 6.</p>\n<p>There are <em>many</em> varieties of tree data structures. We'll be looking at two of them today, binary search trees and AVL trees, but there are so many more. They're used everywhere due to their fast access patterns, even across enormous data sets.</p>\n<p>At its core, a tree is very similar to a LinkedList. You have nodes. Those nodes have values and pointers to other nodes. Unlike a LinkedList which only has one next pointer (or maybe a next and previous) trees can have many pointers. We're going to be looking at two types of trees today that have just two children nodes: binary search trees and AVL trees (which are a special type of binary search tree).</p>\n<p>The first one we'll be looking at is a binary search tree (from here-on-out I'll abbreviate binary search trees as BSTs.) The binary part means there are at most two children nodes per node and the search part means that it's particularly well suited for \"search\" scenarios e.g. you need to be able to rapidly access data in it, even if it means slower inserts and deletes.</p>\n<p>So we have one node that is the root. That node can have a left child and a right child. It can have both, one, or neither. Every node has a value. Both children are nodes just like the root: they can 0-2 children as well and will always have a value (there are no nodes without values.) Every value in a node's left tree is smaller than its value and every node in its right tree is larger than its value. Values that are equal can go either way, just be consistent. I tend to put equal values on the left.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 576px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/complete-intro-to-computer-science/static/8333499546d84a58751a5a12a8f34e9b/533c1/bst.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 83.50000000000001%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"binary search tree\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/complete-intro-to-computer-science/static/8333499546d84a58751a5a12a8f34e9b/533c1/bst.png\"\n        srcset=\"/complete-intro-to-computer-science/static/8333499546d84a58751a5a12a8f34e9b/772e8/bst.png 200w,\n/complete-intro-to-computer-science/static/8333499546d84a58751a5a12a8f34e9b/e17e5/bst.png 400w,\n/complete-intro-to-computer-science/static/8333499546d84a58751a5a12a8f34e9b/533c1/bst.png 576w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p><sup>Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons</sup></p>\n<p>If the any of the above rules are violated, then your tree isn't a binary search tree.

In this case, we're not hopefully not looking at <em>every</em> item in the tree, just some small sampling of them. The average case here would be O(log n). The best case is that someone asks for the root which be O(1). The worst case if that if you have a poorly made BST where every child is on the left (or right) and you have to look at every item in the array to find it. That would be O(n).</p>\n<h2 id=\"add\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#add\" aria-label=\"add permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Add</h2>\n<p>What if we want to add an element to the array?

Obviously a node still has to exist there, and remember all nodes have values. So how do we delete 5 without fracturing all the assumptions of the BST? There are two ways: replace 5 with the smallest child in the right child's subtree or the greatest child in the left subtree. Let's do the former. What is the greatest child in the left subtree? Well, you just follow right children in the left subtree until you hit the last one. In this case, it's just 6, only one hop. But if 5.5 was there, you'd hop one more.</p>\n<p>Okay, so we found the least child in the right subtree. By definition, this node will not have a left child. Otherwise what you found wouldn't be the least one in this subtree. We're going to do two things: take its value and replace the value we're trying to delete (in this case 5) and then move 6's right child to node we're over writing's left child. Let's write that step-by-step.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">-> .delete called on 5\n-> call .find on 5\n  -> start with root, 10. 5 is less, go left\n  -> found 5\n-> .findLeastRightChild with 5\n  -> go right on 5, land on 8\n  -> go left as far as we can. only one hop, 6\n-> replace the node that 5's value with 6\n   (the new 6 / old 5 node will be represented as 6')\n\n         10\n       /   \\\n     6'     15\n    / \\    /  \\\n   3   8  12  17\n      /\n     6\n      \\\n       7\n\n-> set 8 left child to be 6 right child\n\n         10\n       /   \\\n     6'     15\n    / \\    /  \\\n   3   8  12  17\n      /\n     7</code></pre></div>\n<p>This is the most complicated scenario. Let's glance at the other two possibilities.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">   10\n  /  \\\n 5   15\n\n-> delete 15\n-> it has no children (leaf node), set its parent right child to null\n\n   10\n  /\n 5</code></pre></div>\n<p>In this case you just wipe out the whole node when the node to delete is a leaf node.</p>\n<p>Okay, one more case.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">   10\n  /  \\\n 5   15\n    /\n   12\n  /  \\\n 11  14\n\n-> delete 15\n-> 15 has no right child but does have a left child\n-> set 10 right child to be 15 left child\n\n   10\n  /  \\\n 5   12\n    /  \\\n   11  14</code></pre></div>\n<p>When one of the children is null, you can just move its entire child to be the new child.</p>\n<p>The Big O of this would be still be O(log n).

Why would you ever use one? It's because they're very searchable. You're doing a bunch of work up front to make them easy to search later.</p>\n<p>One really good example that very frequently uses some variety of tree is database indexes. Let's say you have a database of all your orders and customers frequently search for their order by order number. We don't want to comb the whole database to find the one order: that'll be slow and taxing on your database. We also don't want to store the whole database in a tree: sometimes we want multiple indexes and we want to optimize the database so we can write quickly to it which keeping it in a tree would hinder.</p>\n<p>So we'll store the whole database in one data structure and then we'll keep a separate tree that we can use an index. When a user searches for their order number, we do a fast find on our tree, it points to where the item is in our database and we get a fast look up on a big database. O(log n) on large datasets is very fast.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exercises\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#exercises\" aria-label=\"exercises permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Exercises</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://codesandbox.io/s/github/btholt/algorithms-exercises?file=/specs/bst/bst.test.js\"><img src=\"https://codesandbox.io/static/img/play-codesandbox.svg\" alt=\"Edit algorithms-exercises\"></a></p>\n<p>We're going to work on <a href=\"https://github.com/btholt/algorithms-exercises/blob/main/specs/bst/bst.test.js\">/specs/bst/bst.test.js</a>.

If you need a reminder of what a set is, see the previous course. In exchange for being really fast and memory efficient, bloom filters trade off the fact that it can't tell you definitely if an item is in the set; it can only tell you definitely that item is <strong>not</strong> in the set. Stated differently, bloom filters have a false positive rate but do not have false negatives.</p>\n<p>Why is that useful? Sometimes you don't care about false positives, you just want to make sure something is <em>not</em> in the set. <a href=\"https://blog.medium.com/what-are-bloom-filters-1ec2a50c68ff\">Medium</a> has a great article on what they use bloom filters for: they use them to filter out articles they don't want to show you in their recommendations, whether those are items you've read before or things they've recommended too many times. What about that false positive rate? Well, they'll just filter out something they could have shown you and then show you something they definitely can show you. It's an acceptable trade off.</p>\n<p>Check out <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter#Examples\">Wikipedia</a> for some more examples of applications.</p>\n<p>So let's talk about how they work.</p>\n<p>Imagine you have an array with ten elements in it. Every element in the array is a <code class=\"language-text\">0</code> bit. This is an empty bloom filter. Now we want to add <code class=\"language-text\">\"Brian\"</code> to the array. I'm going to run <code class=\"language-text\">\"Brian\"</code> through three different hashing functions (see previous course for explanation on hashing functions.) Each hashing function should be <em>fast</em> and definitely not cryptographically secure (which are by-design slow.) This means <em>don't</em> use SHA or MD5. They should also have a uniform distribution as much as possible.</p>\n<p>Okay, so I run my string through three different hashing functions and they give me <code class=\"language-text\">2</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">5</code>, and <code class=\"language-text\">8</code> (I'm making up the numbers; we won't implement hashing functions so it doesn't really matter how they work.) I'll flip all those bits at those indexes so my new array is <code class=\"language-text\">[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0]</code>.</p>\n<p>After doing this, I'll check to see if <code class=\"language-text\">\"Sarah\"</code> is in the array. After running through the hashing function, they give <code class=\"language-text\">2</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">2</code>, and <code class=\"language-text\">4</code>. <code class=\"language-text\">2</code> is flipped but <code class=\"language-text\">4</code> is not, so I can definitively say that <code class=\"language-text\">\"Sarah\"</code> is not in the data set.</p>\n<p>So let's add one more item to the array, <code class=\"language-text\">\"Simona\"</code>. The indexes we get back <code class=\"language-text\">0</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">4</code>, and <code class=\"language-text\">5</code>. So now our array is <code class=\"language-text\">[1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0]</code>. We flip both 0 and 4 indexes and 5 was already flipped so we do nothing to it. Now what happens if we check <code class=\"language-text\">\"Sarah\"</code> again? This time we'll get a false positive that <code class=\"language-text\">\"Sarah\"</code> is in the dataset. That's why the two answers you can get back from the question \"Is X in the bloom filter\" are no and maybe.</p>\n<p>That's it!</p>\n<p>So when you add more items to a bloom filter, you'll increase your false positive rate. You can mitigate this by having a larger array, but you'll be trading off on having a larger memory footprint. You can also have more or less hashing functions, trading off on how quickly memory will fill up versus false positive rates.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exercises\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#exercises\" aria-label=\"exercises permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Exercises</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://codesandbox.io/s/github/btholt/algorithms-exercises/tree/main?file=/specs/bloom-filters/bloom-filters.test.js\"><img src=\"https://codesandbox.io/static/img/play-codesandbox.svg\" alt=\"Edit algorithms-exercises\"></a></p>\n<p>We're going to work on <a href=\"https://github.com/btholt/algorithms-exercises/blob/main/specs/bloom-filters/bloom-filters.test.js\">/specs/bloom-filters/bloom-filters.test.js</a>.

The former is the simplest code and really only useful if the list you're searching on is not sorted in any way.

A telephone book is a sorted list of names. You'll open the book more or less to the middle (or say you do, for argument's sake.) From there, if the name you're looking for is smaller/earlier in the alphabet, you'll go halfway to the smaller/earlier side of the book, and so-on-and-so-forth, keeping going halfway until eventually you land on the name you're looking for. Let's see how that works in practice.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">[0, 5, 10, 12, 15, 19, 21, 22, 24, 30]\n\nsearch for 12\n\nstart in the middle, is 19 === 12? no, smaller, go left\n\nlook in the middle of the smaller half, 10 === 12? no, larger, go right\n\nlook in the middle of the larger half (which is now just one number), is 12 === 12? yes, found element</code></pre></div>\n<h2 id=\"exercises\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#exercises\" aria-label=\"exercises permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Exercises</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://codesandbox.io/s/github/btholt/algorithms-exercises/tree/main?file=/specs/search/search.test.js\"><img src=\"https://codesandbox.io/static/img/play-codesandbox.svg\" alt=\"Edit algorithms-exercises\"></a></p>\n<p>We're going to work on <a href=\"https://github.com/btholt/algorithms-exercises/blob/main/specs/search/search.test.js\">/specs/search/search.test.js</a>.

Breadth-first isn't recursive processing of subtrees like depth-first. Instead we want to process one layer at a time. Using the tree above, we want the resulting order to [8, 3, 10, 1, 6, 14, 4, 7, 13]. In other words, we start at the root, and slowly make our way \"down\" the tree.</p>\n<p>The way we accomplish this is using our old friend, the queue. A queue is an array that the first thing you into is the first thing you get out of it (FIFO, first in first out, as opposed a stack which is first in last out, FILO.) Another way of thinking about it is that if you call dequeue on a queue, the item that has been in there the longest is the one that comes out.</p>\n<p>What we're going to do is process the node, then add the left child to the queue and then add the right child to the queue. After that, we'll just dequeue an item off of the queue and call our function recursively on that node. You keep going until there's no items left in the queue.</p>\n<p>Let's do the exercise!

This is really useful if you're looking for something you know is going to be near the root of the tree or if you're looking for the \"closest\" (e.g. least hops) node to something. For example, if your tree represents a social network and you're looking to recommend to them who to follow, you might do a breadth-first traversal of their social contacts and recommend them people with 2 degrees of separation. Breadth-first traversal is perfect for that.</p>\n<p>Breadth-first traversals are useful for many things and we'll be using the algorithm when we do path-finding, but the gist of when you use them is that you know the answer for what you're looking for is \"closer\" to the root node as opposed to far away when you would use depth-first. Again, it's all trade-offs and what you're trying to do.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exercises\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#exercises\" aria-label=\"exercises permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Exercises</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://codesandbox.io/s/github/btholt/algorithms-exercises/tree/main?file=/specs/traversals/breadth-first.test.js\"><img src=\"https://codesandbox.io/static/img/play-codesandbox.svg\" alt=\"Edit algorithms-exercises\"></a></p>\n<p>We're going to work on <a href=\"https://github.com/btholt/algorithms-exercises/blob/main/specs/traversals/breadth-first.test.js\">/specs/traversals/breadth-first.test.js</a>.

The bubble sort is a typical first one to do because it matches the human mental model of sorting pretty well. The algorithm is pretty simple: compare two items in an array that are next to each other. If they're out of order (that is, the larger one comes first in the array) swap them. Then move forward one index, compare again, swap if needed, and continue to the next item in the array. Once we've reached the end of the array, if we've swapped anything in the previous run through, the array <em>could</em> still be out of order, so we have to pass through again. Once we run through the whole array with no swaps, the array is sorted!</p>\n<p>Let's do a short example.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">[1, 5, 4, 2, 3]\n\nAre 1 and 5 out of order? No.\nAre 5 and 4 out of order? Yes. Swap.\n\n[1, 4, 5, 2, 3]\n\nAre 5 and 2 out of order? Yes. Swap.\n\n[1, 4, 2, 5, 3]\n\nAre 5 and 3 out of order? Yes. Swap.\n\n[1, 4, 2, 3, 5]\n\nEnd of the array, did we swap anything? Yes. Loop again.\nAre 1 and 4 out of order? No.\nAre 4 and 2 out of order? Yes. Swap.\n\n[1, 2, 4, 3, 5]\n\nAre 4 and 3 out of order? Yes. Swap.\n\n[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\nAre 4 and 5 out of order? No.\nEnd of the array, did we swap anything? Yes. Loop again.\nAre 1 and 2 out of order? No.\nAre 2 and 3 out of order? No.\nAre 3 and 4 out of order? No.\nAre 4 and 5 out of order? No.\nEnd of the array, did we swap anything? No. List is sorted.</code></pre></div>\n<p>That's it!</p>\n<p>So, one more fun trick. Eventually, on your first runthrough, you will find the biggest number and will continue swapping with it until it reaches the last element in the array (like we did with 5 in our example.) This is why it's called bubble sort: the biggest elements bubble to the last spots. Thinking about this for a second, that means at the end of the iteration we're guaranteed to have the biggest element at the last spot. At the end of our first iteration above, 5 is the last element in the array. That means the last element in the array is definitely at its correct spot. That part of the array is sorted. So, on our second run through of the array, we technically don't need to ask <code class=\"language-text\">Are 4 and 5 out of order? No.</code> because know ahead of time that 5 is going to be bigger no matter what. So we can check one less element each iteration because we know at the end of each iteration we have one more guaranteed element to be in its correct. At the end of the second iteration we'll have 4 in its correct place, then 3, then 2, etc.</p>\n<p>It's a little optimization (in our Big O it'd affect the coefficient so it'd wouldn't reflected in the Big O.) but it does make it a bit faster. It makes the sorting go faster as algorithm progresses.</p>\n<h2 id=\"big-o\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#big-o\" aria-label=\"big o permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Big O</h2>\n<p>So what is the computational complexity of this algorithm? Let's talk worst case, best case, and average case.</p>\n<p>What is the absolute best, ideal case for this algorithm? A sorted list. It'd run through the list once, comparing each element to its neighbor once, not swap anything, and be done. In our list of five that would be four comparisons and no swaps. Best case here is O(n) since the best case is just one run through so it'd grow linearly.</p>\n<p>What is the absolute worst case scenario? It'd be a backwards sorted list. Then it'd have to run all comparisons and always swap. Assuming we did the optimized version above, that'd be 4 comparisons and swaps on the first go-around, then 3, then 2, then 1, totalling 10 comparisons and swaps. This will grow exponentially as the list gets bigger. This would be O(n²).</p>\n<p>Okay, so average case. You can think of average case as \"what happens if we through a randomly sorted list at this\". For our bubble sort, it'd be like the one we did above: some numbers in order, some not. What happens if we through 10 at it versus 1000. The amount of comparisons and swaps would grow exponentially. As such, we'd say it's O(n²) as well.</p>\n<p>What about the spatial complexity? In our case, we're operating on the array itself and not creating anything else in memory, so the spatial complexity of this is O(1) since it'd never grow. Because we are operating on the array itself, we'd say this sort is <strong>destructive</strong>. What if you needed to keep the original array in addition to the sorted one? You couldn't use this sorting method or you'd have to pre-emptively make a copy. Other sorting algorithms are non-destructive.</p>\n<p>Is this sorting algorithm <strong>stable</strong>? To be considered a stable sort, the sort must guarantee that if two things are <em>equal</em> that that they stay in that same order. For example, if we have an array of users that looks like this: <code class=\"language-text\">[{state: \"CO\", name: \"Sarah Drasner\"}, {state: \"CA\", name: \"Shirley Wu\"}, {state: \"CA\", name: \"Scott Moss\"}]</code> and we're sorting by state, we'd have to guarantee that Shirley comes before Scott for the sort to be considered stable. Sometimes this is important to you, sometimes you don't care. So is bubble sort stable? Yes, it'll guarantee that equivalent items come back in the order they were in.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exercises\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#exercises\" aria-label=\"exercises permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Exercises</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://codesandbox.io/s/github/btholt/algorithms-exercises?file=/specs/bubble-sort/bubble-sort.test.js\"><img src=\"https://codesandbox.io/static/img/play-codesandbox.svg\" alt=\"Edit algorithms-exercises\"></a></p>\n<p>We're going to work on <a href=\"https://github.com/btholt/algorithms-exercises/blob/main/specs/bubble-sort/bubble-sort.test.js\">/specs/bubble-sort/bubble-sort.test.js</a>.

Your goal throughout this course is to make these tests pass. In each directory there at tests that called <code class=\"language-text\">*.test.js</code> that you will be modifying to make them pass. Right now all their tests will say <code class=\"language-text\">test.skip(…)</code>. Anything with that <code class=\"language-text\">skip</code> will not run that test. As soon as you remove the <code class=\"language-text\">.skip</code> so it just says <code class=\"language-text\">test(…)</code> it will start running those tests. I do that because CodeSandbox will run the tests as you type. It makes it really easy to make a mistake that will lock up your browser with infinite recursion or infinite looping. Try to write you code first, then remove the skip. <strong>Save your work before running it.</strong></p>\n<p>There are also <code class=\"language-text\">*.solution.test.js</code>. These are the correct answers I wrote. This is not a test. The only cheating you can do in this course is cheat yourself out of learning. I've found I frequently learn the most when I struggle a bit to get to there. Allow yourself to struggle. Think about it a lot. Walk away and come back. But there's a difference between spinning your wheels and learning. If you find yourself doing the former, take a gander at the solution and see if that helps you wrap your mind around it. Do what's best for your learning. Copying a solution is way better than giving up.

The basic gist is that for each of the nodes, you process the node (in our case, save it to an array since we're serializing this tree,) then process the left subtree and then the right tree. Let's write out that works.</p>\n<p>Given the above tree:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">\n-> Call our method (let's call it preorderTraverse) on the root node, 8.\n-> Add 8 to our array.\n-> Call preorderTraverse on the left child, 3.\n-> Add 3 to our array.\n-> Call preorderTraverse on the left child, 1.\n-> Add 1 to our array.\n-> Has no children, returns.\n-> Going back up the tree, we'll call preorderTraverse on 6.\n-> Add 6 to our array.\n-> Call preorderTraverse on the left child, 4.\n-> Add 4 to our array.\n-> No children, returns.\n-> Going back up the tree, we'll call preorderTraverse on 7.\n-> Add 7 to the array.\n-> So on and so forth.\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>We end up with the array of [8, 3, 1, 6, 4, 7, 10, 14, 13]. This is called preorder traversal.</p>\n<p>The other variants are quite similar; the only thing we do is change the order. When I say \"process the node,\" I mean you do whatever operation you're going to do: add it to an array, copy the node, or whatever that may be.</p>\n<p>In preorder traversal, you process the node, then recursively call the method on the left subtree and then the right subtree.</p>\n<p>In inorder traversal, you first recursively call the method on the left tree, then process the node, and then call the method on the right tree.</p>\n<p>Postorder traversal, as you have guessed, you recursively call the method on the left subtree, then the left subtree, then you process the node. The results of these are as follows:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">// preorder\n[8, 3, 1, 6, 4, 7, 10, 14, 13]\n\n// inorder\n[1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 13, 14]\n\n// postorder\n[1, 4, 7, 6, 3, 13, 14, 10, 8]</code></pre></div>\n<p>As you can see, it depends on what you're doing on which of these you use. For a sorted list out of a BST, you'd want to use inorder. If you're making a deep copy of a tree, preorder traversal is super useful since you'd copy a node, and then add its left child and then its right tree. Postorder would be useful if you're deleting a tree since you'd process the left tree, then the right, and only after the children had been deleted would you delete the node you're working on.</p>\n<p>So let's go give this a shot!</p>\n<h2 id=\"exercises\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#exercises\" aria-label=\"exercises permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Exercises</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://codesandbox.io/s/github/btholt/algorithms-exercises/tree/main?file=/specs/traversals/depth-first.test.js\"><img src=\"https://codesandbox.io/static/img/play-codesandbox.svg\" alt=\"Edit algorithms-exercises\"></a></p>\n<p>We're going to work on <a href=\"https://github.com/btholt/algorithms-exercises/blob/main/specs/traversals/depth-first.test.js\">/specs/traversals/depth-first.test.js</a>.

Graphs are all about modeling relations between many items. For example, think of Facebook's Social Graph. I'm friends with you and you're friends with me. But you're also friends with six hundred other people which is about five hundred fifty too many. Those people in turn also have too friends. But many of my friends are your friends, so the connections aren't linear, they're … well, they're graph-like.</p>\n<p>In the Facebook example, each person would be a node. A node represents some entity, much like a row in an SQL database. Every so-called \"friendship\" would be called an edge. An edge represents some connection between two items. In this case, our Facebook friendship is bidirectional: if I'm friends with you then you're friends with me. Twitter would be an example of a unidirectional edge: just because I follow you doesn't mean you follow me.</p>\n<p>Graphs are <strong>everywhere</strong>. Your various social networks, your Internet of Things devices that have relationships with each other, your neural-networks machine-learning libraries, everywhere. As we continue to model more-and-more of the natural world in virtual space graphs become ever-more important since relationships between things and beings exist all around us.</p>\n<p>In your example, you'll be tracing a made-up social network. In this social network, you're going to be trying to find the most common job title amongst the people you follow. At the first level, it's easy, you just look at your immediate connections and loop over them and see what their jobs are. However, if we go further than that, we have to look at connections' connections! Hopefully this sounds vaguely familiar … it sort of sounds like working with trees! Aw 💩 we have to use those same algorithms again!! So let's visualize a basic graph</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">   Bob — Sally\n  /    \\\nme    Alice\n  \\    /\n   Maria</code></pre></div>\n<p>In this case, let's say I'm looking for what the job titles are for the people within my second degree network: my connections and their connections, or no more than two edges away from me. If hop first to Bob, then I'll count Sally and Alice in his connections. If I hop to Maria, then I'll count Alice in her connections … for the second time. This is where graphs differ a bit: since there's no clear parent-child relationship you need to be aware there will be cycles (e.g. A points to B, B points to C, C points to A, circles in graphs) and other more difficult patterns to deal with. In this case, I'll just keep track of users I've crawled before and not add them to my total the second time.</p>\n<p>So traversing algorithm fits best here? We're analysizing everything in a limited depth of a sub-tree and breadth-first is well equipped to do that. Instead of letting breadth-first traversal run to completion, we'll just limit how many times that outer loop runs, effectively limiting how many levels down it goes, or how many degrees of separation!</p>\n<p>So let's see how you'd do it with out little graph</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">   Bob — Sally\n  /    \\\nme    Alice\n  \\    /\n   Maria\n\n-> Add me to queue\n-> Dequeue me\n-> Add my job to the tally (program manager)\n-> Queue my connections, Bob and Maria\n-> Dequeue Bob\n-> Add Bob's job to the tally (designer)\n-> Queue Bob's connection, Sally and Alice\n-> Dequeue Maria\n-> Add Maria's job to the tally (program manager)\n-> Queue Maria's connections. Alice has already been queued so don't add any.\n\n-> Finish first iteration, one degree of separation</code></pre></div>\n<p>Now if we did another degree of separation, we'd add Alice and Sally's jobs to the tallys. So we have an outter for loop that goes for each degree of separation. Then you have an inner loop (probably a while loop) that dequeues items from your queue and processes them. You'll then queue up their connections to be processed for the next iteration.</p>\n<h2 id=\"databases\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#databases\" aria-label=\"databases permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Databases</h2>\n<p>There are whole databases that just deal with graphs!

We covered most of our sorts earlier in the course but this one required knowledge of trees before it was going to make sense.</p>\n<p>Let's first address what a heap is. A heap is an array that represents a tree data structure and has to be sorted in a particular way to represent that tree. Priority queues are often represented as heaps and often those two terms are used interchangeably even if the the priority queue is implemented a different way.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A priority queue is a normal queue that when you queue something it has a priority associated with it. Things that are higher priority are dequeued first. Think of your Internet traffic and how it handles data packets. If you're both syncing your Dropbox and watching Netflix, the Netflix packets would be higher priority because if you drop those the video stutters whereas the Dropbox stuff can happen whenever and you'd never notice. This would be well modeled as a priority queue. And those are usually stored as heaps.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We're going to be talking about binary heaps today but know there are others. A binary heap translates to a binary tree, similar to the binary search trees that we covered earlier. Let's list out what makes a BST (binary search tree) and a binary heap different</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A binary heap is an array; a BST is made up of node objects (typically.)</li>\n<li>In a BST, there is a strict order where a left child is always smaller than the parent and the right node is always greater. This is not true of a binary heap. The only guarantee of binary heap is the parent is greater than the children, there are no guarantees between sibling nodes.</li>\n<li>Similar to the above point, if you do an in-order traversal of a BST, you'll get a sorted list. This does not work in a binary heap.</li>\n<li>A binary heap is a \"complete binary tree.\" This means it's as compact as possible. All the children of each node are as full as they can be and left children are filled out first. This is not true of a BST: they can be sparse.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Binary heaps come in two falvors: max heaps and min heaps. We'll be dealing with max heaps (which help you find the greatest number in the heap) but you can imagine that if you flip all the comparisons you'd have a min heap (which helps you find the smallest number.)</p>\n<p>So this is why a priority queue is often a binary heap: it's very easy to tell the largest number in a binary heap. None of the other is guaranteed, but once you dequeue (or take the next element off) it's easy to find the next item in the queue. In fact, that's how heapsort works: you construct an internal priority queue and then remove an item at a time and stick it at the end and then find the next largest item in the priority queue; rinse and repeat.</p>\n<p>The way to represent a binary tree as an array is that for any index of an array <em>n</em>, its left child is stored at 2n + 1; and its right child is at 2n + 2. The root node will always be at 0. That means the root node's left child is at 1 and right child is at 2. 1's left child is at 3 and right is at 4.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 640px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/complete-intro-to-computer-science/static/38d462612230f54d41456fd320ab8eaf/6af66/heap.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 120%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Binary Heap Visual Diagram\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/complete-intro-to-computer-science/static/38d462612230f54d41456fd320ab8eaf/6af66/heap.png\"\n        srcset=\"/complete-intro-to-computer-science/static/38d462612230f54d41456fd320ab8eaf/772e8/heap.png 200w,\n/complete-intro-to-computer-science/static/38d462612230f54d41456fd320ab8eaf/e17e5/heap.png 400w,\n/complete-intro-to-computer-science/static/38d462612230f54d41456fd320ab8eaf/6af66/heap.png 640w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p><sup>Kelott, CC BY-SA 4.0 <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0\">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0</a>, via Wikimedia Commons</sup></p>\n<p>Once you construct a heap, removing an item from it is done in constant time since you need to find the next largest node to move to the root.

From there, we start with the next element in the list (in this case, the 1 index, the second element) and loop backwards over our sorted list, asking \"is the element that I'm looking to insert larger than what's here? If not, you work your way to the back of the array. If you land at the first element of the sorted part of the list, what you have is smaller than everything else and you put it at the start.

A reverse sorted list. You'd have to make every comparison possible since the numbers would be moving from the end of the list to the beginning of the list every single iteration and have to move an item every single iteration. This would be O(n²)</p>\n<p>What's the best case scenario? An already-sorted list. In this case, it would only make ask the question \"is x the larger than y? Yes.\" It would never do any extra comparisons and it would never need to make any swaps. This would be O(n). This is when you would consider using insertion sort over something like quick sort or merge sort: if the arrays you're going to be sorting are likely to be sorted already or very close to it (a few swaps is cheap.) This will make it faster than quick sort and merge sort.</p>\n<p>What's the average case of a randomly shuffled array? Well, it'll make a lot of comparisons and swaps, and those just grow exponentially as the array grows, so it'll still be O(n²). Not great for average-case use, only nearly-sorted situations.</p>\n<p>What about spatial complexity? O(1)! We don't create any additional items for this sort.</p>\n<p>The sort <em>is</em> destructive since we work on the array itself and the sort can be stable as long as you program it so that they stay in order during the insertions.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exercises\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#exercises\" aria-label=\"exercises permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Exercises</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://codesandbox.io/s/github/btholt/algorithms-exercises?file=/specs/insertion-sort/insertion-sort.test.js\"><img src=\"https://codesandbox.io/static/img/play-codesandbox.svg\" alt=\"Edit algorithms-exercises\"></a></p>\n<p>We're going to work on <a href=\"https://github.com/btholt/algorithms-exercises/blob/main/specs/insertion-sort/insertion-sort.test.js\">/specs/insertion-sort/insertion-sort.test.js</a>.

I'm so excited to share with you some of my knowledge that I've earned working in the field. The skills here I picked up in my first few years of college. While you may not necessarily write a bubble sort at work, you will absolutely use principles and techniques learned here for the rest of your career. In particular, the skills here will help you interview for tech jobs since a lot of the questions asked by big tech companies are either directly related or derived from these classic algorithms and data structures which were largely invented in the 50s, 60s, and 70s. Understanding and writing these bits of codes will help these concepts sink into your thinking as well as the general science of trading off various aspects of how you write code.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This course is hard. Like, really hard. Even if you've done all these things before, there is so much brain power to get through these exercises. Make sure you're practicing self-care by giving yourself the mental space necessary to learn these concepts. Don't expect to get everything on the first try. I'd recommend taking this course slowly, splitting it across multiple sessions. Don't get frustrated with yourself. There's a reason why colleges don't teach these things all at once.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"who-is-this-course-for\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#who-is-this-course-for\" aria-label=\"who is this course for permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Who is this course for?</h2>\n<p>For you!</p>\n<p>This course is for all levels of programmers who want to understand for the first time some of these algorithms and data structures or want more practice with them.

I attended a few years of a computer science program in Utah before dropping out of college to pursue a career in coding. A lot of these concepts I learned in college or during my high school classes and for years I didn't really value what they meant to me. As I got into working at larger companies these concepts started surfacing more and more. It was then that I started to realize that not only did they concepts help you in whiteboarding interviews (they do) but they also teach you a way of thinking that's super valuable. Hopefully I can help you learn to love these methods of structured thinking and logic.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 800px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/complete-intro-to-computer-science/static/6f2a2c1faae82a8c6d3f4ef1d12f04ad/c58a3/brian.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 33.5%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Brian speaking at conference\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/complete-intro-to-computer-science/static/6f2a2c1faae82a8c6d3f4ef1d12f04ad/4b190/brian.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/complete-intro-to-computer-science/static/6f2a2c1faae82a8c6d3f4ef1d12f04ad/e07e9/brian.jpg 200w,\n/complete-intro-to-computer-science/static/6f2a2c1faae82a8c6d3f4ef1d12f04ad/066f9/brian.jpg 400w,\n/complete-intro-to-computer-science/static/6f2a2c1faae82a8c6d3f4ef1d12f04ad/4b190/brian.jpg 800w,\n/complete-intro-to-computer-science/static/6f2a2c1faae82a8c6d3f4ef1d12f04ad/e5166/brian.jpg 1200w,\n/complete-intro-to-computer-science/static/6f2a2c1faae82a8c6d3f4ef1d12f04ad/c58a3/brian.jpg 1500w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>When I'm not working at Microsoft or working on Frontend Masters content I try to get away from my keyboard.

I want to thank them for creating the platform, garnering a community of knowledge-seeking developers, and giving me incentive and a platform to speak to you all. One specific kindness is that while the videos are on the platform (and I think they are worth every penny to watch) they let me release this website and materials as open source so every person can acquire the knowledge.</p>\n<p>Thanks Frontend Masters.

LinkedList is made of a bunch of nodes that point to the next one in the list. Every node in a LinkedLists has two properties, the value of whatever is being store and a pointer to the next node in the list. These nodes will not be sequential in memory, meaning we don't get the easy lookups but the advantage is that adding things is easy since we don't have to do the compacting we had to do with ArrayList.</p>\n<p>So let's talk about look ups. You only have access to a head node. The head node will point to the 1 node. The 1 node points to the 2 node, etc. If we want to lookup index 10,000 we're going to have to make 10,000 jumps. That means the lookups grow with length and therefore the Big O is O(n) for lookups.</p>\n<p>Let's chat about where LinkedLists are useful then. What do we need to do if we want to delete index 10? We'll first do a lookup node 9 and we'll change the pointer of node 9's to point at node 11. Done! So these deletions are O(1). Again, remember, we consider lookups and deletions as separate actions.</p>\n<p>Let's dissect a delete.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">value: [a]   [b]   [c]   [d]\nnext:  [ ]-> [ ]-> [ ]-> [ ]-> null\n\n-> delete is called on index 2 (value 'c')\n-> grab the head (value 'a')\n-> loop through the nexts until you get the index\n   before the one to be deleted (value 'b')\n-> change the the next of index 1 to be the next of index 2\n-> decrement length\n-> return the value of the deleted node</code></pre></div>\n<p>Let's look at insertions. Let's say I want insert at 10. I'd lookup node 9, point its next at the new node, and point the new node's next at the old node 10. Done! O(1) as well.</p>\n<p>As you can see, the inserts and deletes work great. This makes it ideals where you're doing a lot of writes and deletions. In general, ArrayList tends to be the most generally useful because the lookup speed is so helpful, but LinkedLists definitely have their place.</p>\n<p>There are other variations of LinkedLists as well. One is a doubly LinkedList, where you have a previous and next pointer on each node. This can be helpful if you want to be able to do lookups from the tail or from the head.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exercises\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#exercises\" aria-label=\"exercises permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Exercises</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://codesandbox.io/s/github/btholt/algorithms-exercises/tree/main?file=/specs/arrays/linkedlist.test.js\"><img src=\"https://codesandbox.io/static/img/play-codesandbox.svg\" alt=\"Edit algorithms-exercises\"></a></p>\n<p>We're going to work on <a href=\"https://github.com/btholt/algorithms-exercises/blob/main/specs/arrays/linkedlist.test.js\">/specs/arrays/linkedlist.test.js</a>.

Well, what if we break it into two smaller lists and sort those? Okay, great but now we just have the same problem just smaller. Cool, let's break that those each into smaller lists and try again.</p>\n<p>Eventually we're going to end up with lists of length 1 or 0. By definition (as I keep saying lol) a list of 1 or 0 is already sorted. Done! Sounds like a base case, doesn't it?</p>\n<p>Okay, so now we have two sorted lists. What if we merged them back together in a way that we're sorting as we go. We'll take those two smaller sorted lists and combine them back into one larger sorted list. And then we'll do that with the bigger lists until we've merged them all back into one sorted list.</p>\n<p>So we need two functions. One is the first function to break down the big lists into smaller lists (the recursive function) and the other is a function that takes two <strong>sorted</strong> (I bold because this function should assume that these two lists it receives are always sorted already) and returns back one sorted function. The first function is recursive and the second is not.</p>\n<p>Let's do an example. Recursion is a bit hard to diagram but stick with me. We'll do it in the order it would be evaluated. I'm using the <code class=\"language-text\">//</code> to show you that everything after the <code class=\"language-text\">//</code> isn't being called now but we'll come back to when recursion on the left side of the call finishes. I'm using the <code class=\"language-text\">-- depth &lt;number></code> to show you we are <code class=\"language-text\">&lt;number></code> calls deep in the call stack.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">\nmergeSort([1, 5, 7, 4, 2, 3, 6]) -- depth 0\n\nmergeSort([1, 5, 7, 4]) // mergeSort([2, 3, 6]) -- depth 1\n\nmergeSort([1, 5]) // mergeSort([7, 4]) -- depth 2\n\nmergeSort([1]) // mergeSort([5]) -- depth 3\n[1] is of length one.

Let's talk about <em>worst</em> case scenario here. Well, every case is the worst case scenario. And the best. And the average. No matter what, the array always gets broken down into lists of 1 and then built back up. Notice that <code class=\"language-text\">mergeSort([2, 3, 6])</code> was already sorted but it didn't matter. So for merge sort all three of best, worst, and average case computational complexity the answer will be the same.</p>\n<p>Let's about the Big O then. Every item in the array will be looked at least once. So that means that we're going to be at least O(n). Then we need to compare those items to other items in the array. But how many times? Does it diminish as the list gets longer or not? It turns out it does diminish.</p>\n<p>Notice that the 1 in our example never gets compared to the 7 in the array. How? Well, when the array breaks down into smaller pieces, the 7 gets put in a group with 4. The 1 does get compared at one point to the 4 and gets sorted before the 4. We, by virtue of knowing that everything after 4 in that list larger than 4, don't need to compare 1 to each of those numbers. We get to take a short cut. So, as our array grows larger and larger, we get to take more and more shortcuts. This the hallmark of a <code class=\"language-text\">log n</code> sort of behavior: the larger the list gets, we get diminishing amounts of more things to do.</p>\n<p>So let's combine our two terms together. This sort's computational complexity is O(n log n). And that's the best average/worst case for a general purpose sort that we're going to get. This will definitely be significantly faster than the O(n²) we've been seeing so far on larger lists.</p>\n<p>What about spatial complexity? Notice we're creating and throwing away a lot of array. This isn't free, and on a large list can be a problem. Merge sort is among the worst because we'll create an array for every item in the array (plus a few more which would just be a coefficent so Big O wouldn't care) so the spatial complexity is O(n).</p>\n<h2 id=\"exercises\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#exercises\" aria-label=\"exercises permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Exercises</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://codesandbox.io/s/github/btholt/algorithms-exercises/tree/main?file=/specs/merge-sort/merge-sort.test.js\"><img src=\"https://codesandbox.io/static/img/play-codesandbox.svg\" alt=\"Edit algorithms-exercises\"></a></p>\n<p>We're going to work on <a href=\"https://github.com/btholt/algorithms-exercises/blob/main/specs/merge-sort/merge-sort.test.js\">/specs/merge-sort/merge-sort.test.js</a>.

You could probably write some variant of looking to see if yA (the y of the A coordinate) is less than yB (y of the B coordinate). If it is, move one square from yA to yB. Rinse and repeat for the x axis. This works and given the current constraint will find you one of the shortest paths. It'd look something like:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">• • • • • •\n• A • • • •\n• 1 • • • •\n• 2 • • • •\n• 3 • • • •\n• 4 5 • • •</code></pre></div>\n<p>Now let's add a wall to the mix.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">• • • • • •\n• A • • • •\n• • • • • •\n• X X X X X\n• • • • • •\n• • B • • •</code></pre></div>\n<p>Suddenly our algorithm falls apart. You could probably devise some strategy to mitigate this but we can keep making more complicated wall structures to make it harder. So let's try something different: Dijkstra's algorithm.</p>\n<p>The basic gist of Dijkstra's algorithm is that we'll start at both the beginning and the end node and begin \"spiraling\" outwards, marking each node with how far away it is from from its original Node. We'll alternate spiraling one level with one node, and then one level with the other. After one iteration of the point A (doesn't matter if you start with the A or B) it'd look like:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">• 1 • • • •\n1 A 1 • • •\n• 1 • • • •\n• X X X X X\n• • • • • •\n• • B • • •</code></pre></div>\n<p>Then we'd do the same to point B which would like this:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">• 1 • • • •\n1 A 1 • • •\n• 1 • • • •\n• X X X X X\n• • 1 • • •\n• 1 B 1 • •</code></pre></div>\n<p>We'll do this until we intersect the two spirals. As soon as the spiral intersect we know we've found the shortest possible path. Let's keep going with point A:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">2 1 2 • • •\n1 A 1 2 • •\n2 1 2 • • •\n• X X X X X\n• • 1 • • •\n• 1 B 1 • •</code></pre></div>\n<p>Notice this algorithm accounts for obstacles: if there's an obstacle, you just skip that node and keep going.</p>\n<p>Now point B:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">2 1 2 • • •\n1 A 1 2 • •\n2 1 2 • • •\n• X X X X X\n• 2 1 2 • •\n2 1 B 1 2 •</code></pre></div>\n<p>You get the point, we alternate. So let's do the next steps for both point A and B.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">2 1 2 3 • •\n1 A 1 2 3 •\n2 1 2 3 • •\n3 X X X X X\n3 2 1 2 3 •\n2 1 B 1 2 3</code></pre></div>\n<p>You can see they've intersected but our algorithm hasn't made that connection yet. But on the next iteration, as the spiraling is happening, those that point will see that the node it's going to has been marked by another origin point. Because of that, we know that we've found one of the shortest paths (there could be other paths that connect of the same length.) As such we've solved our problem: the shortest path is of length six. If you were keeping track of the nodes, you could give the coordinates of the path.</p>\n<p>So, given this as the basic gist, let's speak about the more technical details. The way to accomplish is <em>very</em> similar to what we just did with tree traversals. In fact it's literally the same algorithm applied a different way. Let's take point A and reimagine it as a tree.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">        A [1,1]\n     /  /     \\   \\\n[1,0] [0,1] [1,2] [2,1]\n/| |\\ /| |\\ /| |\\ /| |\\\n  [lots more children]</code></pre></div>\n<p>Instead of each node having at most two children like a binary search tree, each node has at most four children. Okay, now that we're thinking of this matrix as a tree, what we want to do is investigate first the nodes surrounding it, or in tree terms: its immediate children. We literally just learned how to do that with trees. It's breadth-first traversal! Let's apply the same secret algorithmic sauce to our problem here. We're going to take the root node (A) and add all of its children (neighbors, really) to a queue, and then begin processing each node as we pop them off the queue. Remember we need to alternate processing point A and point B, so we'll just alternate which ones we're pushing on the queue. Finally we'll have to keep track of visited nodes and distances, we'll just keep a duplicate matrix and mark it with what length it was and which origin point marked it. That's it!</p>\n<p>Technically what we're is actually breadth-first search, but the mechanics of Dijkstra's algorithm is the same and so the two are often conflated with each other. <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25449781/what-is-difference-between-bfs-and-dijkstras-algorithms-when-looking-for-shorte\">See here</a> for a more thorough explanation.</p>\n<p>If you want to see how this works using a visualizer, <a href=\"https://qiao.github.io/PathFinding.js/visual/\">check this out</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exercises\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#exercises\" aria-label=\"exercises permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Exercises</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://codesandbox.io/s/github/btholt/algorithms-exercises/tree/main?file=/specs/pathfinding/pathfinding.test.js\"><img src=\"https://codesandbox.io/static/img/play-codesandbox.svg\" alt=\"Edit algorithms-exercises\"></a></p>\n<p>We're going to work on <a href=\"https://github.com/btholt/algorithms-exercises/blob/main/specs/pathfinding/pathfinding.test.js\">/specs/pathfinding/pathfinding.test.js</a>.

Above I mentioned that occasionally JavaScript doesn't merge sort for Array.prototype.sort. In those other cases, it's usually some variant on quick sort.</p>\n<p>It's another divide-and-conquer, recursive algorithm but it takes a slightly different approach. The basic gist is that you take the last element in the list and call that the pivot. Everything that's smaller than the pivot gets put into a \"left\" list and everything that's greater get's put in a \"right\" list. You then call quick sort on the left and right lists independently (hence the recursion.) After those two sorts come back, you concatenate the sorted left list, the pivot, and then the right list (in that order.) The base case is when you have a list of length 1 or 0, where you just return the list given to you.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">[4,9,3,5] list\n-> 5 is made the pivot since it's the last in the array\n-> divide list into two lists, [4,3] and [9]\n-> call quicksort on those two lists\n\n[4, 3]\n-> 3 is pivot\n-> call quicksort on [] and [4]\n-> those both return as is as they are the base case of length 0 or 1\n-> concat [], 3, and [4]\n-> return [3,4]\n\n[9]\n-> returns as this it is a base case of length 1\n\n(back into the original function call)\n-> call concat on [3,4], 5, and [9]\n-> return [3,4,5,9]</code></pre></div>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 384px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/complete-intro-to-computer-science/static/4a14b48b386ca8457bbbef9063a27135/804b2/quicksort-diagram.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 200%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"quick sort diagram\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/complete-intro-to-computer-science/static/4a14b48b386ca8457bbbef9063a27135/804b2/quicksort-diagram.png\"\n        srcset=\"/complete-intro-to-computer-science/static/4a14b48b386ca8457bbbef9063a27135/772e8/quicksort-diagram.png 200w,\n/complete-intro-to-computer-science/static/4a14b48b386ca8457bbbef9063a27135/804b2/quicksort-diagram.png 384w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 384px) 100vw, 384px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p><sup>Znupi, Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons</sup></p>\n<h2 id=\"big-o\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#big-o\" aria-label=\"big o permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Big O</h2>\n<p>What is the worst case for quick sort? A sorted list. The pivot would always be the largest number in the array, meaning the left array would always be full and the right array would always be empty. In order for us to get that log n magic instead of just n, we need to be able to skip some comparisons. If it's sorted, we will compare every number against every other so we'd end up with O(n²). Same would apply with a reverse-sorted list.</p>\n<p>What's the best case scenario? It's actually the same the average case scenario: a randomly sorted list. That way the pivots will tend to be more in the middle so we'll get a good mix in our left and right arrays which is where that log n magic comes in. In these cases, it'll be O(n log n) like merge sort.</p>\n<p>What about spatial complexity? In the way that I'm going to have you do it, it'll be O(n). We'll be creating new arrays for each recursive call. This makes quick sort more clear to understand and for now that's what we're optimizing for: the actual algorithmic thinking.</p>\n<p>It is possible to implement quick sort as a destructive sort that operates in-place and uses some other tricks like tail call optimization. In this case its spatial complexity will be O(log n) as will still make some memory allocations on the call stack, but far fewer than merge sort does. For this reason, the spatially-effecient version of quick sort will frequently be favored over merge sort due to its lesser memory footprint.</p>\n<h2 id=\"variations\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#variations\" aria-label=\"variations permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Variations</h2>\n<p>In addition to the memory effecient version discussed above, there are other tricks around the pivot that we can do to mitigate our worst case scenarios. The most common is called quicksort3 where you take the first element, the middle element, and the last element and takes the middle value as the pivot, guaranteeing at least that your pivot isn't the smallest or biggest element. It does add a few more comparisons to your sort so it does add overhead but at the benefit basically removing the worst case scenario. Others will just choose a random pivot each time. Most of the variations revolve around pivots.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exercises\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#exercises\" aria-label=\"exercises permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Exercises</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://codesandbox.io/s/github/btholt/algorithms-exercises/tree/main?file=/specs/quick-sort/quick-sort.test.js\"><img src=\"https://codesandbox.io/static/img/play-codesandbox.svg\" alt=\"Edit algorithms-exercises\"></a></p>\n<p>We're going to work on <a href=\"https://github.com/btholt/algorithms-exercises/blob/main/specs/quick-sort/quick-sort.test.js\">/specs/quick-sort/quick-sort.test.js</a>.

Up to this point all of the sorts we've talked about have been comparison based sorts. That is to say, we decide the order of the numbers based on asking the question is this element bigger than that one over-and-over again until numbers are in order and the rest of the algorithm is just optimizing how often we ask that question. The big O of these comparison based algorithms cannot be any faster n log n so in order to get beyond that, we have to change what we're doing. We have to sort based on other criteria.</p>\n<p>So how do we ask sort a whole list of numbers if we never ask \"is X bigger than Y\"? Well, we sort <em>parts</em> of the array. We're going to sort the ones place first, so all the numbers in the ones place are in order from 0 to 9 e.g. if we had the list of <code class=\"language-text\">[109, 224, 901, 58]</code> after the first was we would have <code class=\"language-text\">[901, 224, 58, 109]</code>. Then we would sort on the tens place, ending up with <code class=\"language-text\">[901, 109, 224, 58]</code>. Then we'd sort by the hundreds, getting <code class=\"language-text\">[58, 109, 224, 901]</code>. And now we're sorted! Magic! It's a bit mind-bending but it does work! And honestly it's that simple.</p>\n<p>So what's the mechanism of doing this? Buckets! For base doing a positive integer radix sort (it's possible to do others but let's stick to the easy one for now) we will create ten buckets, one for each integer zero to nine. Then we'll loop <code class=\"language-text\">d</code> times where <code class=\"language-text\">d</code> is the maximum length of a number in our array. So if the longest number in our array is 90932 then <code class=\"language-text\">d</code> would be 5. Then in the inner loop we would enqueue all the numbers in the buckets based on what digit we were sorting and then dequeue them back into the main array. JS doesn't have queue semantics so we'll use <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/push\">push</a> for enqueue and <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/shift\">shift</a> for dequeue. We repeat this process until we get through <code class=\"language-text\">d</code> and the array is sorted!</p>\n<h2 id=\"big-o\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#big-o\" aria-label=\"big o permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Big O</h2>\n<p>So, this is way different than what we've been doing. So far we've just had <code class=\"language-text\">n</code> as a variable which represents how many items there are to sort. In radix sort (and other ones too) we have multiple variables. <code class=\"language-text\">n</code> is still important but now we have another variable in play here (usually called <code class=\"language-text\">k</code> or <code class=\"language-text\">w</code>. Let's go with <code class=\"language-text\">k</code> for our purposes.) <code class=\"language-text\">k</code> is going to represents the \"maximum key length\", or <code class=\"language-text\">d</code> as we referred to it as above. The more buckets we need, the larger the complexity. So intead of being O(n²) or O(n _ n), it ends up being O(n _ k). So is it better or worse than O(n log n) sorts? It depends! If you have a lot of numbers with lots of varied lengths that will bucket into a good distribution it can be very effective. If you numbers [1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000] etc it ends up being the worst sort. It ends up being O(n²) at that point.</p>\n<p>What about the spatial complexity? It ends up being O(n + k) and this why radix sort is really only used in very specific circumstances: it's not great in terms of how much space it takes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exercises\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#exercises\" aria-label=\"exercises permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Exercises</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://codesandbox.io/s/github/btholt/algorithms-exercises/tree/main?file=/specs/radix-sort/radix-sort.test.js\"><img src=\"https://codesandbox.io/static/img/play-codesandbox.svg\" alt=\"Edit algorithms-exercises\"></a></p>\n<p>We're going to work on <a href=\"https://github.com/btholt/algorithms-exercises/blob/main/specs/radix-sort/radix-sort.test.js\">/specs/radix-sort/radix-sort.test.js</a>.

So <code class=\"language-text\">fibonacci(3)</code> is equal to <code class=\"language-text\">fibonacci(2) + fibonacci(1)</code>. So the answer to <code class=\"language-text\">fibonacci(100)</code> is <code class=\"language-text\">fibonacci(99) + fibonacci(98)</code>.</p>\n<p>To generalize this, <code class=\"language-text\">fibonacci(n) = fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)</code>. This is a recursively defined problem.</p>\n<p>So let's tackle this one piece at a time. The first question we have to ask ourselves is <strong>what is the base case</strong>. The base case is when we stop recursing. If we don't have a base case, then our recursion will spiral out of control and we will get a <strong>stack overflow</strong> (hence the name of the helpful website) when we run out of memory. In our case, our base case is that we are given that <code class=\"language-text\">fibonacci(2) = 1</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">fibonacci(1) = 1</code>, and <code class=\"language-text\">fibonacci(0) = 0</code>. <em>Almost always</em> with recursion your base case will be the first line of your recursive function. You need a good reason for that not to be the case.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There are negative fibonacci numbers. We're ignoring them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Okay, so let's write our function then.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"javascript\"><pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code class=\"language-javascript\"><span class=\"token keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"token function\">fibonacci</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token parameter\">n</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"token comment\">// base case</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">if</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>n <span class=\"token operator\">===</span> <span class=\"token number\">2</span> <span class=\"token operator\">||</span> n <span class=\"token operator\">===</span> <span class=\"token number\">1</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token keyword\">return</span> <span class=\"token number\">1</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">else</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">if</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>n <span class=\"token operator\">&lt;=</span> <span class=\"token number\">0</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token keyword\">return</span> <span class=\"token number\">0</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n\n  <span class=\"token comment\">// recursive calls</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">return</span> <span class=\"token function\">fibonacci</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>n <span class=\"token operator\">-</span> <span class=\"token number\">1</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token operator\">+</span> <span class=\"token function\">fibonacci</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>n <span class=\"token operator\">-</span> <span class=\"token number\">2</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>A little mind-melting, right?

Since recursive functions will break down into further recursive calls, all of them eventually eventually end in a base case. In the <code class=\"language-text\">fibonacci(5)</code> call, you can see eventually all of them end up in n either equalling 2 or 1, our base case. So to get our final answer of 5 (which is the correct answer) we end up adding 1 to itself 5 times to get 5. That seems silly, right?</p>\n<p>So what if we call <code class=\"language-text\">fibonacci(30)</code>? The answer is 832040. You guessed it, we add 1 to itelf, 832040 times. What if we call <code class=\"language-text\">fibonacci(200)</code>? Chances are you'll get a stack overflow.</p>\n<p>Not very efficient here, but very elegant code. Here you'd need to trade off having readable code versus a relatively poor performance profile. If your use case says you'll only need to call no more than with n = 10, yeah, this is probably okay. If you need to call it with n = 200, you need to rewrite it to something different.</p>\n<p>Here's the iterative solution:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"javascript\"><pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code class=\"language-javascript\"><span class=\"token keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"token function\">fibonacci</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token parameter\">n</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> sequence <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token number\">0</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token number\">1</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">for</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token keyword\">let</span> i <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">2</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span> i <span class=\"token operator\">&lt;</span> n <span class=\"token operator\">+</span> <span class=\"token number\">1</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span> i<span class=\"token operator\">++</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    sequence<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">push</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>sequence<span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>i <span class=\"token operator\">-</span> <span class=\"token number\">2</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span> <span class=\"token operator\">+</span> sequence<span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>i <span class=\"token operator\">-</span> <span class=\"token number\">1</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">return</span> sequence<span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>n<span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>Not terribly long, but it's definitely harder to get your mind around.

Now, let's say for every zip code we add to our system, we calculate the distance between every other zip code in our system and store it. If there were only 10 zip codes, sure, that'd be easy, but there are nearly 42,000 zip codes in the United States with more being added.

One isn't necessarily better than the other. And very frequently you need to make the trade off of computational complexity vs spatial. Some algoriths eat a lot of memory but go fast and there are lots that eat zero memory but go slow. It just depends on what your needs are.</p>\n<p>Here's an example: let's say you're writing code that's going to be run a PlayStation 3 and it needs to sort 1000 TV shows according to what show you think the customer is going to want to see. PS3s have a decent processor but very little memory available to apps. In this case, we'd want to trade off in favor of spatial complexity and trade off against computational complexity: the processor can do more work so we can save memory.</p>\n<p>Okay, now same problem but we have 1,000,000 videos and a big, beefy server in the cloud to do the work for us. In this case we're not resource constrained by either memory or compute so we can feel free to trade off in favor of computational since we want to respond to the user as soon as we can.</p>","frontmatter":{"path":"/spatial-complexity/","title":"Spatial Complexity","order":"2B","section":"Algorithm Analysis","description":"Brian talks about Big O as it's applied to how much space something needs"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p>Besides being useful in interviews, why do we even talk about Big O?

The temptation after learning about these concepts is to try to optimize every piece of code that you come across. \"How can this have the loweset Big O?\" is the wrong question to ask. Let's go over some guiding principles.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>There are no rules. \"Always do <em>blank</em>\". Everything has context. These are just tools and loose decision-making frameworks for you to use to make a contextually good choice.</li>\n<li>There are frequently multiple good choices and almost never a perfect, \"right\" choice.</li>\n<li>Remember how I said that Big O allows you to ignore the coefficients (the <code class=\"language-text\">3</code> in the <code class=\"language-text\">3x²</code>)? Sometimes those actually end up being super important. Big O, again, is just a broad stroke. Sometimes the details are super important.</li>\n<li>Just as frequently, even the broad strokes are super unimportant. If you have a function that is called just once a day as a background job, it doesn't matter if it finishes in 300 milliseconds or 30 seconds (probably, again, context is important.) Don't spin your wheels on unimportant things.</li>\n<li>In my experience, <strong>readability</strong> and <strong>maintainability</strong> are the most important things about code. Code is communication. Clever, performant code is fun to write but hard to maintain later when you have to go figure out what the hell you actually wrote. We write code so that later humans can understand it and secondarily so computers can execute it. If it was just for computers we'd all still be writing assembly. Write your code like you were writing a letter to a future human (probably yourself) on how this works.</li>\n<li>Taking the above into account, err on the side of simple code. Simple code is easier to maintain because you can understand it easier and typically ends up having less bugs.</li>\n<li>Human time is almost always more valuable than computer time.</li>\n<li>Normally it's a good idea to not prematurely optimize code. As a general principle, I try to <em>have</em> a perf problem before I try to solve it. Premature optimization will cause you a lot of problems. Frequently you're not solving the right problem and you're left when harder-to-deal-with code.</li>\n<li>99% of the time you want to use the built-in features to a language or an existing module to do these sorts of heavy lifting. Rarely are you going to write your own sort, you'll just call <code class=\"language-text\">.sort()</code>. Usually your implementation won't be faster because the built-ins can do tricks you can't (like run it in C/Rust) and they tend to have far less bugs because so many people use them.</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"path":"/trade-offs/","title":"Trade Offs","order":"2C","section":"Algorithm Analysis","description":"Brian goes over why we use Big O and the art of making trade offs"}}},{"node":{"html":"<p>First of all, let's make sure you're saying this word correctly. The word \"trie\" is a play on the fact that this particular data structure makes it easy to re<strong>trie</strong>ve data, so trie is said just like it is there, tree. However, because tries and trees are often discussed together, you'll here people call them \"tries\" (as in the plural try) or try to disambiguate them in other methods. Good luck.</p>\n<p>Okay, so what is a trie? It's a tree. LOL. It's a tree that's optimized for searching by prefix. The classic example of what you would use this for is autocomplete: you know when you type in \"San\" and it offers suggestions of what to finish with like \"Francisco\", \"Diego\", or \"Jose\". Tries are really useful for that.</p>\n<p>So let's examine what looks like. A trie starts with a root node that doesn't represent anything (often it's given the <code class=\"language-text\">value</code> of <code class=\"language-text\">''</code> (empty string.) It has a bunch of child nodes (as many are necessary) that represent one letter, the first letter of all the words added to the data structure. Each of those letter-nodes will have children nodes for all the <em>second</em> letters of the words that are represented in the data structure. So on and so forth, there will be a chain of nodes that represent each letter in the data structure.</p>\n<p>Why is this useful? If a user types <code class=\"language-text\">bo</code> in the text input, you can go through your data structure, find the <code class=\"language-text\">o</code> node in that chain, and then all you have to do is a depth-first traversal of the children nodes to for a list of autocomplete suggestions.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">  a – [various children]\n /\nb – o – s – t – o – n\n     \\\n      i – s – e</code></pre></div>\n<p>So based on this, you'd get suggestions of \"Boston\" and \"Boise\".</p>\n<p>Since some words are contained within chains of others (for example, there are two separate cities, one called \"Salina\" and one called \"Salinas\" or \"Sandy\" and \"Sandy Springs\".) You'll often have a flag in there that signifies the node you're on is a complete word so you can just add it to the list and then keep going on the children.</p>\n<p>There are more complicated things you can do with tries as well that we won't explore here. You can have autocompletes for mid-word completions (if I type \"francisco\" it won't autocomplete \"san francisco\" at the moment.) You can add weights to certain edges/children so they're suggested first (so San Francisco comes before San Mateo.) But this exercise, assume all words weighted equally.</p>\n<p>You'll also represent a space in the tree as its own node so when you type <code class=\"language-text\">san&lt;space></code> it autocompletes San Francisco instead of Santa Fe. In other words, no characters are given special treatment. That can be unintuitve.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exercises\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#exercises\" aria-label=\"exercises permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Exercises</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://codesandbox.io/s/github/btholt/algorithms-exercises/tree/main?file=/specs/tries/tries.test.js\"><img src=\"https://codesandbox.io/static/img/play-codesandbox.svg\" alt=\"Edit algorithms-exercises\"></a></p>\n<p>We're going to work on <a href=\"https://github.com/btholt/algorithms-exercises/blob/main/specs/tries/tries.test.js\">/specs/tries/tries.test.js</a>.
